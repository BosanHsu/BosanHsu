# Welcome to Bosan's Github Profile!

## 👋 Hey, I'm Bosan!
I recently graduated from WashU in St. Louis where I studied Business Analytics and Accounting. I enjoy working with data to solve real problems, especially in areas like sports, finance, and business strategy. I’ve used tools like Python, machine learning, and Tableau to find insights and make smarter decisions.

I’m also a big sports fan. Basketball and baseball are my favorites. I built an AI project to improve fantasy baseball drafts and loved every part of it. Fantasy sports is more than a game for me. It’s a way to test ideas, build models, and compete using data.

## 🏆 Proud Projects Summary (By Category)
# 🟨 Sports Analytics
# Fantasy Baseball Draft (Reinforcement Learning)
I built an AI that learns how to draft fantasy baseball teams in a smarter way. It used reinforcement learning to make better picks and boosted the win rate by over seven percent. INFORMS selected this project for their poster competition, which made me pretty proud.

# Baseball Player Performance
I worked on a project to predict how fast a baseball leaves the bat. I used different models and found that Random Forest worked best. I also discovered that certain bat angles give better results.

# 🧠 Other Machine Learning and NLP Projects
# Crypto Trading with Machine Learning
I created trading bots that use machine learning to make Ethereum trading decisions. Some of them had big returns but also higher risk. I compared the models and learned how to build strategies that perform better in the long run.

# Stock Price and Twitter Sentiment
I looked at how tweets affect stock prices for companies like Apple and Tesla. I used sentiment analysis to see if positive or negative tweets could predict how the stock moves. I found that negative tweets often signal upcoming volatility.

# Resume and Job Matching with Deep Learning
I built a deep learning model that matches resumes with job descriptions. I used a twin network structure to see how similar the text is. The model was very accurate and worked better than a simple LSTM.
