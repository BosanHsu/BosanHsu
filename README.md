# Welcome to Bosan's Github Profile!

## 👋 About Me
Hi there! I’m Bosan Hsu. With a background in Business Analytics, Accounting, and Economics, I’ve got a knack for seeing things from different angles—whether it’s through Statistics, Finance, or Game Theory. I’m also a big sports fan—basketball 🏀 and baseball ⚾ are my favorites—and a serious fantasy sports player. Think you can beat me? Bring it on!

Currently, I’m pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics and a Master of Accounting at Washington University in St. Louis. My focus is on machine learning, deep learning, cloud computing, database management, and accounting. My ultimate goal? To turn data into actionable insights.

Washington University: My schoolwork and projects from WashU.
