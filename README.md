# Welcome to Bosan's Github Profile!

## 👋 Hey, I'm Bosan!
I thrive at the intersection of Business Analytics, Accounting, and Economics, using my expertise in Statistics, Finance, and Game Theory to tackle complex problems from multiple angles. Oh, and I’m a die-hard sports fan—basketball 🏀 and baseball ⚾ are my go-to, and if you think you can outplay me in fantasy sports… well, let’s see about that!

At the core, I love turning raw data into powerful, actionable insights—whether for business, sports, or beyond.
